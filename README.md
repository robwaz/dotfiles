# robwaz's dotfiles / quick install script

These are my commonly used dotfiles and base install script for quickly installing my preferred packages and tools on mac linux, and dockerized environments.

The goal of this repo is serve as a sane baseline for packages and configs I generally expect everywhere.  Since the overarching goal is for it provide a consistent experience across hosts, some settings are less than ideal, but tend to work everywhere.

Use at our own risk!

## Usage - DO NOT DO THIS
```
git clone git@github.com:robwaz/dotifles ~/
mv ~/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install.sh
```
