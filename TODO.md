## Python tools

For a few years now I've adopted [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as my preferred way of dealing with python and virtual environments.

For most python tools, I  clone down the project and use `uv tool`.

A few notable projects:
- [top4grep](https://github.com/Kyle-Kyle/top4grep)
- [decomp2gdb](https://github.com/mahaloz/decomp2dbg)
